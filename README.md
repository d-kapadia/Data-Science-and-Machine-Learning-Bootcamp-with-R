# Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning-Bootcamp-with-R
Contains project work that i did as part of the Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp with R

The RMD folder contains raw code used to generate the Notebooks
The HTML folder contains the notebooks

The Notebooks can be viewed here (Because Github does not support R Notebooks):
